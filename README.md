This is a web queue worker library inspired by a Derek Comartin video [Web-Queue-Worker Architecture Style for Scaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niAA3bprjNU). I've done some work with background services [BackgroundService.Extensions](https://github.com/adamfoneil/BackgroundService.Extensions), but hadn't done anything with multiple, coordinated workers. I've played a little bit recently with [Coravel](https://github.com/jamesmh/coravel), and it has a nice queueing feature. But as usual, I wanted to try thinking through the problem myself just to get my head around it.

At the heart of this are some [interfaces](https://github.com/adamfoneil/AsyncWorkflow/tree/master/AsyncWorkflow/Interfaces):
- [IQueue](https://github.com/adamfoneil/AsyncWorkflow/blob/master/AsyncWorkflow/Interfaces/IQueue.cs) defines fundamental operations on a persistent queue of some kind
- [IStatusRepository](https://github.com/adamfoneil/AsyncWorkflow/blob/master/AsyncWorkflow/Interfaces/IStatusRepository.cs) defines a standard way of tracking success, failure, or any kind of process outcome for all workers
- [ITrackedPayload](https://github.com/adamfoneil/AsyncWorkflow/blob/master/AsyncWorkflow/Interfaces/ITrackedPayload.cs) is something you'd implement on a payload model that you need to identify uniquely

The actual `BackgroundService` implementation is [WorkflowBackgroundService](https://github.com/adamfoneil/AsyncWorkflow/blob/master/AsyncWorkflow/WorkflowBackgroundService.cs). A few key points:
- The first thing to look at is the [ProcessNextMessageAsync](https://github.com/adamfoneil/AsyncWorkflow/blob/master/AsyncWorkflow/WorkflowBackgroundService.cs#L34) call. This is where the worker is doing its main work within the `BackgroundService.ExecuteAsync` loop, which is running continually [until canceled](https://github.com/adamfoneil/AsyncWorkflow/blob/master/AsyncWorkflow/WorkflowBackgroundService.cs#L29).
- The outcome of that work recorded with [Status.SetAsync](https://github.com/adamfoneil/AsyncWorkflow/blob/master/AsyncWorkflow/WorkflowBackgroundService.cs#L43). This captures the duration, status result, and name of the worker (handler) that did the work.
- When work is done, the worker has a chance to define what happens next with the [OnCompletedAsync](https://github.com/adamfoneil/AsyncWorkflow/blob/master/AsyncWorkflow/WorkflowBackgroundService.cs#L53) method. This is gives us a chance to coordinate sequential and parallel work.
- The dequeing of messages and parsing json payload data happens in [ProcessNextMessageAsync](https://github.com/adamfoneil/AsyncWorkflow/blob/master/AsyncWorkflow/WorkflowBackgroundService.cs#L68)
